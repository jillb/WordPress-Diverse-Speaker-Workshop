# Speaker Training Workshop

We are keeping track of how many WP groups run the workshops this year.
If you’re planning on running it, please either [let us know here](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/diversity-speaker-training-workshop/)
or message @jillbinder on Slack.

# Meetup Description You Can Use

Does the thought of speaking at a WordPress event intrigue you? This is
a workshop for folks from underrepresented groups who are thinking about
speaking at WordPress events, such as WordPress meetups and WordCamps.
The focus of this hands-on session is to look at what has stopped you
from speaking in the past and explore how to move past your fears,
generate WordPress-related topics to give a talk on, boost your speaking
confidence, and allow you to practice speaking in a safe space. At the
end of the workshop you will have a few ideas for talks, an outline on
one topic, a title, a pitch/proposal for applying to events, a bio, and
a chance to practice speaking.

*** You do NOT have to have any experience in public speaking. This workshop is for all levels of experience.

 **This workshop is for you if:**

- You identify as being from an underrepresented group  
- You’ve thought about speaking at meetups or WordCamps but haven't been able to think of a topic
- You think you don't know anything worth speaking about

**We will cover:**
- Why speak at WordPress events?
- Dispelling some myths about speakers/speaking
- Coming up with topics and choosing one
- Writing a meetup description or conference pitch
- Practice speaking in front of a group
- Coming up with a great title
- Writing your bio
- Writing the outline
- Practice giving a short talk

**Accessibility**

- The venue has \[elevators, ramps, etc.\], \[single stall washrooms
for non-binary genders\], \[etc.\].  
- Please do not wear scents. Many people are allergic or sensitive.

### Workshop Assets for Facilitators

- Script (the document you are reading now)  
- [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sd-3J0JO5outGfhE_WVhp5SqAFOzed9l22UQnWOoQBI/edit?usp=sharing)  
- [Suggested Timeline](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CPkbImBkSOwRs-X7FJlBno3GqbWVU5dR/view?usp=sharing)

### Facilitators will need:

- A large device that can show a countdown timer for the timed speaking presentations, such as an iPad. If you have a projector, you could use project [https://e.ggtimer.com/](https://e.ggtimer.com/) instead.  
- Sign up sheet, clipboard, pen

### Teacher Notes

  - None of this is mandatory. Feel free to change any of it in any
    way. If you are wondering if you can do something differently, the
    answer is yes. Do it\!

  - You don’t have to use the whole thing. You could run any part. If
    you only have 1 to 1.5 hours, it is suggested to do parts 1 and 2
    plus the signup at the end. These cover helping everyone feel safe
    and comfortable, Impostor Syndrome, and choosing a topic.

  - Times in Suggested Schedule are approximate and we’ve left a lot
    of buffer time at the end in case of items going overtime.

  - If it’s a small group (15 or less), arrange seats in a circle. If
    it’s a larger group, set up small groups of 4-5 each.  
    In both scenarios, you will be splitting into small groups of 4-5
    each starting in the Pick A Topic section.

  - At the last presentation of the day, we suggest you change the
    room to presentation format (seats in rows facing forward toward
    the speaker).

  - At the end, encourage them via a sign-up sheet or follow up email
    to agree to chat further about speaking at your event. Emphasize
    that this isn’t a commitment, it’s an agreement to have further
    conversation about speaking at your event.

  - Make sure the venue is accessible (ramps, elevators, etc.)

  - Encourage people to write their pronouns on their nametags, if
    they wish. Different color tags or some other visual cue can also
    be helpful.

  - It is useful to have a large device that can show a countdown
    timer for the timed speaking presentations. An iPad would work. If
    you have a projector, you could project
    [https://e.ggtimer.com/](https://e.ggtimer.com/)
    instead.

  - Many choose to run the workshop for their general community. The
    event description is written in such a way to still attract folks
    in marginalized and underrepresented groups. The workshop script
    gives you some additional items to add if you’re running it for
    Diversity.

  - The note at the start about getting up and moving around whenever
    they want to is for accessibility for those who get antsy in their
    bodies.

  - Childminders – who are often women – may be limited to when they
    can attend. Weekend daytimes may work well. Ask those with
    children what works for them.

  - Offer childcare if you can.

  - If you’re doing this for diversity purposes, if at all possible
    have it be organized and led by a representative of the folks whom
    it is for.

  - Watch language, such as gender pronouns and transgender
    terminology. For example, try not to use “ladies and gentlemen”,
    “guys”, etc. Use “folks” or “folx”, “friends”, “group”, etc.

  - The groups we are targeting are referred to as “they.” Please
    change your pronouns according to if you’re a member of the group
    you’re running it for, or if you have a different relationship to
    the group. For example, if you’re a woman giving this workshop to
    a group of women, you don’t need to talk about women as “they”,
    you can say, “we”.

  - If it suits your group better, you can do this online instead of
    in person.

ℹ️ ***\> Diversity Section***
### Why are we holding a workshop for folks from underrepresented groups 

There are a few reasons that we want to hold this workshop for folks
from underrepresented groups today:

1.  A disproportionately large number of the speakers at WordPress
    meetups and WordCamps (and tech events in general) look alike and
    come from the same background. That means that the speakers do not
    represent everyone sitting in the audience. Folks from
    underrepresented groups may, therefore feel like we don't belong
    there. But there are many with a wide range of knowledge to share
    and everyone can feel included.

2.  WordPress is amazing in that it is open source and so all sorts of
    people use it. We want a more fair representation of the users in
    the people who are speaking.

3.  One of the ways in which WordPress is being shaped is by the
    people who speak about it publicly. Many folks from
    underrepresented groups, by nature of having had different life
    experiences, would approach problems differently. Just as how a
    developer's point of view is different from a user's point of
    view, so are our viewpoints. Folks from underrepresented groups
    have experiences that aren't necessarily being shared right now.

4.  By bringing more diversity to the people at the podium, there's a
    better chance of bringing in folks who are straddling several
    roles and thus creating unique things with unique perspectives.
    Power users who use it in interesting ways, front-end developers,
    business people who use plugins to make specific kinds of sites,
    typographers who use WordPress to do wild things with
    typography.... People to talk about running a business in
    WordPress, how developers can communicate with designers,
    different things you can do with WordPress...... etc.

5.  When people see themselves represented on stage, it gives more
    people confidence and helps them feel like they belong there. They
    feel less underrepresented.

### Dispelling The Myths (What We Think A Speaker Is vs What They Actually Are)

Everyone has their own reasons for not speaking in public, especially at
tech events, but most of those reasons are based on myths that we can
dispel or concerns that we can address:

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Myth 1*

#### Myth 1: I’m not an expert\!

That’s okay, you don’t have to be an expert\! Everyone has a different
idea of what “expert” means.

No one knows everything, and everyone has something to learn. You could
know more about your topic than your audience knows. You can find a
topic where you have knowledge that your audience does not.

There are things you do with WordPress all the time that other people
don’t – that makes you an expert in their eyes. Even if your audience
has knowledge about the same topic, they will not frame that knowledge
the same way – they will still have something to learn from you. It’s
also possible that you feel you only know a little bit about a topic,
but it’s still more than many people in the audience who are happy to
learn what you know.

You are probably more of an expert than you think you are. A lot of us
suffer from Imposter Syndrome. This is the psychological phenomenon
where you feel like you are an imposter, you think you don’t really have
the knowledge or skills to be here, but you have managed to fool
everyone and soon they’ll find out. Imposter syndrome is really common –
you aren’t alone.

**ℹ️ \> Diversity section** - A lot of us have imposter syndrome because
we don't see people like us presented as experts. Many people who are  
not part of the over-represented majority set a much higher bar for  
“expert” knowledge.

Many communities have surveyed their members to ask what kind of
information they want to learn at meetups and WordCamps, and most people
request beginner topics. Remember that there are people out there who
know nothing about any of this stuff, and they want to know more\! If
you have used WordPress before, you have knowledge that other people
want you to share.

One area where you are always an expert is your own experience. Case
studies make great talks – talk about how you did something, how you
learned something, how you overcame an obstacle, the process you went
through to create something or to solve a problem.

These kinds of talks are great because they are unique – it’s not just
the same information that anyone can find in an online tutorial. These
topics help everyone overcome the “I’m not an expert” problem – you’re a
normal person sharing a normal experience, and that’s valuable, so
people will come to value their own experience and expertise.

Even if you are giving a talk that the audience knows all about already,
you have a different perspective and they are likely to learn something
new.

So you might not feel like an expert, but you are\! If you care about
your topic, that will shine through and that’s what’s important.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Myth 2*

#### Myth 2: People will ask questions I can’t answer, and I’ll look like a fool.

Yes, people very well might ask questions you can’t answer, but that’s
okay. Your audience understands that not everyone knows everything, and
it can be hard to think on your feet – the audience is sympathetic. If
you don’t know the answer, there are several things you can do:

  - You can ask if anyone in the audience has the answer.

  - You can tell them you will look up the answer and get back to
    them. Tell them you’ll post the answer on your blog – then you get
    more visitors to your website\!

  - Sometimes people ask questions that are off topic – feel free to
    tell them their question is off-topic and you would be happy to
    discuss it with them later.

  - Also, remember that it’s okay to say, “I don’t know” – people will
    think more highly of you if you admit you don’t know than if you
    try to make up an answer.

We’re going to be going into all of these in much more detail in Section
5: Becoming a Better Speaker, in the Tricky Questions section later.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Myth 3*

#### Myth 3: I’m too nervous to speak\!

Your audience gets that too – after all, most of them didn’t have the
bravery to speak.

First of all, practice practice practice\! The more you practice - in
front of pets, family, friends, the mirror, small audiences - the less
nervous you will be.

But if you are still nervous, that’s okay\! Everyone gets nervous in
front of audiences, and that’s just a part of being human. Keep in mind
that your audience is on your side – they want to see you succeed. In
fact, it’s okay to admit that you are nervous – people will be
sympathetic. I’m nervous right now, too, but I’m up here speaking in
front of you and I haven’t died yet\! Making a little joke at the
beginning about being nervous (like I just did) can help dispel the
nervous energy in the room.

If you’re really nervous, you might not want to start by speaking at an
event where you will have a big audience. Start at a smaller meetup, or
even start just in front of the mirror, pets, friends and family, etc.
We’ll talk more about this in the Better Speaker section later as well.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Myth 4*

#### Myth 4: I have failed if everyone in the audience isn’t totally engaged.

Sometimes when you’re speaking, you will look out at the audience and it
will look like everyone is bored. That’s okay.

First of all, most of them probably aren’t as bored as they look.
Audiences generally sit with neutral faces, so if they aren’t smiling
and nodding and cheering, that doesn’t mean they aren’t engaged.

If they are using their phone/tablet/laptop/another device, that doesn’t
mean they’re ignoring you - in fact, it might mean they are writing down
your every word, or they might be live tweeting your talk.

And no matter how good a speaker you are, you will not connect with
everyone in the audience. That’s okay - no speaker can connect with
everyone. Expect that, don’t take it personally, and be happy with the
people who do connect with you.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Myth 5*

#### Myth 5: A talk followed by a Q\&A is the only format I can use to share my knowledge.

No, there are plenty of other ways to share your expertise at WordPress
events. You could lead a group discussion, lead a workshop, or put
together a panel. Some events offer the opportunity for lightning talks,
which are usually about 10 minutes. This is a great format if you’re
nervous because it’s okay to talk fast and it’s over quickly.

**Questions for the group:** What do you think? What are things you're
worried about? Why haven’t you talked at a meetup or WordCamp? If
you've only talked once, why did you not do it again?

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Why do you want to speak? \[title page\]*

### Why Do You Want To Speak?

Those are reasons people don’t want to speak. What about reasons people
do want to speak. Here is another discussion question for you: Why do
you want to speak?

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Why do you want to speak? \[content\]*

Here are some of the common reasons:

1. Be seen as an authority in your field
2. Share your knowledge with others
3. Build your confidence
4. Give back to the community
5. Meet people - be part of the community
6. Travel
7. Learn at conferences - speaking teaches you more
8. It’s fun\!
9. It’s rewarding, you can have a feeling of accomplishment
10. Career building

> **ℹ️ \> Diversity item** - 11. Be a role model for folks from underrepresented groups

> **\> General** - 11. If you identify as someone from an underrepresented group, know that by being on stage you are a role model for folks like you.

### Talk Formats

**ℹ️ \> Diversity** - Now that we've talked about why we are holding
this workshop for  
folks from underrepresented groups, myths about what it takes to be a
speaker,  
and why you want to speak, let's start talking about the actual talks.

**\> General** - Now that we've talked about why we are holding this
workshop, what  
kind of things we're looking for, myths about what it takes to be a
speaker, and  
why you want to speak, let's start talking about the actual talks.

A lot of talks are big "how to" brain dump sessions. "How to make a
plugin" might be someone walking through how to make it, maybe even live
coding, and then at the end, there are questions.

WordCamp Central has found that this isn't necessarily a good way to
impart information. People often walk away feeling overwhelmed and not
remembering anything that they learned.

There are other talk formats that promote story-based learning. Talking
about how you learned something, for example, means other people can
also learn how to learn.

Here are some of the various formats:

  - **How To:** The standard way that tech talks happen

  - **Discussion:** You are the facilitator on a topic and the
    audience discusses it together

  - **Panel:** Multiple people answer questions on the same topic

  - **Story-based:** This could be how you learned something, mistakes
    you made, or any other narrative format

  - **Case Study:** The story of how you created one thing, in
    particular

  - **Workshop:** A hands-on learning experience where people bring
    their laptops and create a thing as you go

A talk can also be more than one person. Talks with 2 or 3 people can be
really engaging.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Brainstorm \[title page\]*

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Brainstorm \[content\]*

### Brainstorm

> **ℹ️ *Facilitator*** *- If you printed the handbooks:*

We are going into our first written exercise now. First we are going to
help you answer the question, "I don't know what to talk about," "I
don't know enough about anything to give a talk,” “I’m not an expert in
anything,” or if you’ve given talks and you’re just stuck for what your
next talk could be, we’ll be answering that as well.

We are going to do a brainstorming exercise. Brainstorm as many topics
ideas as you can in this exercise. We're not looking for "perfect" or
even "good" ideas. The idea is just to get them out, good, bad, or ugly.
See if you can get as many as 30 or 40 ideas. Seriously, anything that
comes to mind.

You can write, draw, do mind-maps, list, any format you like. While
you're summoning inspiration, getting writers' block, or anywhere in
between, we'll be prompting you with questions to generate more topics.

Remember, it's always great to talk about what excites YOU - not what
you think you should talk about.

Also if you are new to WordPress and don’t have answers to these yet,
that’s ok. You can use the prompts to imagine what your answers might be
in a year.

> **ℹ️ *Facilitator*** *- Read one every 30 seconds or so. Give the full 30 seconds – they need more time than it feels to you like they do.*

*These prompts are only suggestions that you can adapt according to the group's traits and needs.*

I’ll give you a moment to start writing any ideas that are coming to
mind already before we start the prompts, and in a moment I’ll start the
first prompt. Go ahead and start writing now.

  - What got you into WordPress?

  - What keeps you in it?

  - What do you love about it?

  - What do you want to learn next?

  - First time you did something: wrote a child theme, a plugin, etc.

  - Biggest challenge in WordPress in the last year or two

  - The last thing that you learned? How did you learn it?

  - The biggest block you’ve ever had with WordPress? How did you
    overcome the biggest block?

  - What are you most passionate about when it comes to WordPress?
    What most excites you?

  - What sorts of things do you love sharing with others about WP?

  - What question about WordPress do you get asked about most by
    clients, friends, and family?

  - A list of what you want to learn

  - Favorite plugin?

  - A cool thing you've created?

  - Favorite resources?

  - Cool tricks you use all the time?

  - What could you talk about without slides?

  - What prompt did we not ask which you wish we did?

Out of curiosity, how many topics did you write down?

> ***Facilitator** - If a small group, have people volunteer to say their number*

> ***Facilitator** - If a large group, ask:* 
> Up to 10? Up to 20? Up to 30?
> Did anyone have more than that? How many did you write?

Good work everyone. You’ve done well. Even just writing down one is great.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Topic selection*

### **✍** Topic Selection

Okay, now you’ve got some good, bad and ugly ideas, we are going to do
an exercise where you are picking the two topics from your list that you
think best fits the following questions. You might also find that you
come up with new answers that weren’t in your list. If so, go ahead and
write those down\! If for some of these you don’t come up with any
answers, that is ok. Just skip that one.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Story-based talk*

1.  For a story-based talk: Pick 2 topics that you don’t know a lot
    about, but have had some success with. (e.g. I don’t know much
    about making plugins but I’ve made one for custom post types).

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Panel*

2.  For moderating a panel: Pick 2 topics you may not know much about
    but that you would have good questions for.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, How-to presentation*

3.  For a how-to-presentation: Pick 2 topics that you are confident
    about and could lead a how-to presentation.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Case study*

4.  For a case study: Pick 2 topics that you’ve successfully worked on
    that you feel you could do a case study about.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Workshop*

5.  For a workshop: Pick 2 topics that you think you could teach to
    others in a hands-on manner. This could be for running a workshop.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Any type*

6.  For any type: Pick 2 subjects in the topic list that are your
    favorite.

> **ℹ️ *Facilitator*** *- If they weren’t already, split the room into
groups of 4-5 people.*

Now we are going to do exercises to pick a topic.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Pick a topic*

### **✍** Pick a Topic *(small groups)*

Go ahead and pick the topic you’re most excited about and you think
you’d like to develop further. For anyone who would like to discuss it
with each other in your groups, I’ll give you 2 minutes each. I’ll give
you a moment to think it through on your own first.

> **ℹ️ *Facilitator*** *- at the end of the time, say:*

Wherever you’re at for now, it’s ok. Just pick one to say to the rest of
the group and that you’ll use for the exercises for the rest of the
workshop. You can always use your topic today as practise and do a
different topic later.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to Slide: Discuss topics*

### 🗣 Discuss topics *(whole room)*

Let’s hear from a few of you the topics you’ve chosen with everyone. If
anyone is having a hard time choosing, we can help you pick which one
we’d be most interested in hearing. Everyone else, see if you can use
the coaching for your own topics.

### **✍** Refining Topic

To further refine your topic, we are going to apply “Who, What, Why,
How, When, Where”. For example: Who is this plug for? What does the
plugins do? Why was this plugin created? How does it work? When would
you use it? Where would you use it?

1. Who
2. What
3. Why
4. How
5. When
6. Where

I will give you 5 minutes to answer these questions.

> ***Facilitator** - When the 5 minutes are up*

However far along you are with that is fine. Just use what you have.

From this list, can you refine your topic? Is there something more
specific on which you’d like to give the talk? I will give you 2
minutes to polish your topic.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Present topic*

### 🗣 Present Topic

### **ℹ️ *Facilitator*** *- Regroup the room into a circle.*

Now we are going to go around the circle (or go around the room) and
give everyone the opportunity to say what topic they chose. If you'd
rather not, when it’s your turn say, "Pass."

> **ℹ️ *Facilitator*** *- If someone seems really doubtful about their
topic, ask  
the group if they would like to hear this topic, put up their hands.
If  
time allows, offer to let students talk for a minute or two about
their  
Topic.

### Writing The Proposal aka “Pitch”

Whatever your motivations for speaking, you first need to get selected
to speak, and for that you need to create a proposal or “pitch” (we will
use the terms interchangeably) that gets your talk selected. Also, since
your proposal defines the scope of your talk, it can be a good early
step in the overall process of developing your talk.

  - What makes a great pitch? Here is an example of a good one:

  - Responsify All The Things – In our new web multiverse, it’s more
    important than ever to make your valuable content available to all
    users, regardless of how they access your site. In this talk,
    we’ll cover how Responsive Web Design came about, the latest RWD
    news and trends, and some basic (and not so basic) techniques you

  - This is a good length, tells you what talk will cover, and who
    it’s aimed at.

  - In some cases you might also want to say what people will walk
    away with from this talk.

  - Beware of too-clever titles. The title should stand on its own

> **ℹ️ *Facilitator*** *- Ask group:* What made this title good or not so
good?

Generally, your talk proposal and the introduction of your outline will
be quite similar. A good introduction should have all the things a good
pitch would have. However, in a pitch you might want to spice it up a
bit. Ultimately, both the introduction and pitch should contain similar
content.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Tailor*

For a pitch, you want to tailor the tone of your writing and vocabulary
to the specific audience and event that you are applying to. This is
very important\!

Some ideas for how you may tailor your pitch for specific audiences and
events:

  - The tone may be different. A business crowd may be formal. A
    meetup may be more casual. So customize the tone of your pitch to
    your specific audience.

<!-- end list -->

  - At WordPress we tend to be pretty casual.

  - You might want to use different vocabulary depending on the
    audience.

  - You may want to stress different “hooks” or “points of interest”
    depending on the audience or event.

#### *Facilitator - Proceed to next slide, 6 Important Points*

#### There are also 6 important points to take note of when writing both your outline and your pitch

(Source:

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Point 1*

1\. **Direct the proposal to the attendees, not the curators.** Many
conferences use your talk proposal as the description of the talk in
their programme. With that in mind, your target reader is the conference
attendee who is reading the programme. Tell the reader why your talk
will interest them, and what they will learn. The curators want to put
together a great conference with compelling talks for their attendees.
Your talk will be part of the package they offer, so sell it\! Make sure
you research the event. Are there different tracks? Who is the audience?
Lots of developers? Mostly for users? Design-heavy? Different WordCamps
have different personalities. Are they short on really technical
presentations? Light on talks for beginners? Try to fill a need (such as
podcasting).

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Point 2*

2\. **Be specific about the focus your talk will have.** Generally
speaking, a shallow introduction to many things is not as interesting as
an in-depth introduction to one thing. If you discuss the broader topic,
do so only to set the context for what you will focus on.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Point 3*

3\. **One strategy: Pose the question your talk will answer.** Often,
talks answer questions that start with “how”, “why”, “when” and so on.
An easy trick is to directly ask these questions in your proposal,
leaving the reader wondering the answer.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Point 4*

4\. **Make your point as succinctly as you can.** If your first draft
requires more than two paragraphs to get to the point of your topic,
edit to narrow things down. Take out any words that can be removed
without changing the meaning. You may have a lot of competition, so try
to make a good impression quickly. If your proposal is too much work to
read or understand, it might get skipped during the selection process.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Point 5*

5\. **Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation.** If you submit a
sloppily written proposal, you appear careless and as if you are not
taking the opportunity seriously. You risk being rejected on those
grounds outright. Speaking requires a lot of thoughtful preparation, and
curators can only assume you will be as careless when preparing the talk
itself.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Point 6*

6\. **Have your proposal reviewed by someone with experience.** Just as
you might ask a friend to critique a draft of your CV, an essay, or the
talk itself, ask someone (ideally a writer, speaker, or curator) to
review your talk proposal. They will catch typos, as well as verify
whether your proposal explains the scope of your talk, and explains its
benefit to your audience.

### Coming Up With a Great Title

"All great talks have a great title\!"

Good talk titles generally follow these guidelines:

  - Try to think of something catchy but explanatory

  - Beware of too-clever titles

  - Create a title that can stand on its own without a blurb (for
    example don’t use something like “CSS and Elephants”). You want
    something that people will understand when they scan the
    conference talk titles. Even in meetups, many people read the
    title and choose attending based on that alone, without reading
    the blurb.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Writing your bio [title page]*

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Writing your bio [content]*

Writing Your Bio

When you submit a proposal or pitch to an event, you will most often be
asked to include a short bio. Bios are often the hardest to write well.
But here are some pointers to follow:

  - Should be written in third-person

  - They should be succinct but descriptive (a short paragraph will
    suffice)

  - Go for economy of words (try to say the most you possibly can with
    the fewest possible words)

  - Mention what your position or job is and any credentials that
    might be relevant.

  - Mention how many years you’ve been in this field or if it hasn’t
    been that many, tell a short story about how you’ve ended up in
    your new field.

  - Look at past examples for the conference you’re submitting to. Why
    are you the right person to give this talk?

  - Tailor your bio so your topic makes sense. You might want to tweak
    it differently for different topics and different events.

  - Be human. WordCamps are usually not too formal.

  - Feel free to add something about your non-professional interests
    at the end, but don’t make it your entire bio.

# 4\. Creating Your Talk

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, In this section*

### In this section

  - Writing the outline

  - Coming up with a great title

  - Present title and outline (optional)

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Writing the outline*

### Writing The Outline

You’ve done the Who What Why How When Where questions about your topic.
With these ideas in mind, you will be creating an outline for your talk.
Don’t worry, we’ll talk you through the outline.

As a basic structure, a talk should have 3 parts: an introduction, body,
and conclusion. Let’s start with the introduction.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Introduction*

#### Introduction

What makes a great introduction?

  - Clearly state what your talk is about

  - What are you going to cover?

  - Why does it matter?

  - Pique interest\! — What is your hook? Open with impact\!

  - Who is it aimed at?

  - Be Succinct\! — Use economy of words

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Tips for your Introduction*

Tips for your introduction:

  - **Don't apologize or insult yourself.** Apologizing in your
    opening calls attention to any flaws you may be concerned about
    and reduces the positive engagement of your audience.

  - **Don't spend 10 minutes talking about your resume.** Many new
    speakers begin by talking about their hobbies, family, or work
    history. The trouble is, before you've begun talking about your
    content, audiences aren't emotionally invested in you yet.
    Spending excessive amounts of time convincing them why they should
    pay attention to you is far less effective than opening with the
    engaging content they're here to see.

  - **Start with a relevant story.** Talk about *why* you're giving
    this talk today. For example, tell a story about a problem you
    encountered, to lead into a talk about how to solve similar
    problems.

  - **Summarize what you'll cover** or what attendees will walk away
    with. This gives a high-level context of where each part of your
    talk falls into the larger topic.

  - **Ask a friend to introduce you.** Better than introducing
    yourself is asking someone close to you to introduce you, to give
    you praise and assign credibility.

#### *Facilitator - Proceed to next slide, Body*

#### Body

Now we are going to create an outline of your talk.

In a moment, you will be writing down some main topics or story headings
you’d like to cover. What is the main point you want to get across? What
are some examples, or supporting points that go to illustrate your main
point? What would be a logical flow?

You can use the “Who, What, Why, How, When, Where” questions to refine
your topic to create your talk sections.

Another tip is people think in 3s, so if you can break your talk down to
3 supporting points that could be helpful. ← fix

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Conclusion*

#### Conclusion

For the conclusion, you will want to:

  - Summarize what has been discussed.

  - Review the main takeaway points.

  - The "So What?" question - why does your topic matter?

  - Give further resources that may be useful to attendees.

  - Be sure to give the audience your contact information. An email
    and/or Twitter handle is good.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Great title*

### Refining Your Title

Once you have your outline, you might want to further refine the title
for your talk to be more specific\!

You want to:

  - Try to think of something catchy but explanatory

  - Beware of too-clever titles

  - Create a title that can stand on its own without a blurb (for
    example don’t use something like “CSS and Elephants”)

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Present title and outline*

### **✍** Exercise: Outline and Title

Spend 10 minutes quickly drafting up the body of your talk and writing
down some possible talk titles refinements. Don’t overthink this. Just
write quickly off the top of your head.

If you have extra time you can work on introduction and conclusion as
well, but the most important thing right now is the body. The rest will
come from that.

### ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Practicing speaking*

### Practising Speaking

The most important thing you can do to become a better speaker is to
practise\! The more you speak - in front of a mirror, in front of
friends, or in front of a room full of people - the more comfortable and
the better you will become. You can even give your talk to a friend over
the Internet via Skype, Zoom, or other teleconference softwares.

You can also video record yourself. Take notes on behaviors you exhibit
while speaking, then practice reducing them.

When you practice, time yourself. You might be surprised by how long or
short your talk is when you are speaking out loud, and it is important
to know how long your talk is going to take.

If you're looking for opportunities to practice speaking, you might see
if there is a Toastmasters in your area. They will provide you with many
opportunities to speak in front of a supportive group of people, and
give you tips and tools for improvement.

You can also practise at smaller meetups. WordPress meetups are good for
practising for WordCamps. If you want to practise for WordPress meetups,
you could find smaller related meetups who would be interested in
hearing about your WordPress topic.

### ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Better speaker tips, Do*

### Becoming a Better Speaker Do's and Don'ts

No matter how much public speaking experience you have, there is
always room for improvement. Here are some do's and don'ts to help you
improve.

#### Do:

  - **Speak slowly.** Many speakers speak too fast, but audiences
    almost never complain that someone went too slowly. Take pauses in
    between sentences. It may feel strange to you, but will seem very
    natural to the audience.

  - **Have water available and drink it.** Most events will provide
    water for the speaker, but make sure you have water on hand just
    in case. When you find yourself going too fast, taking a drink of
    water is a great way to slow yourself down. It might feel like it
    takes forever to take a drink, but the audience doesn't mind.

  - **Vary your voice.** This gets easier with practice. You don't
    want to speak in a monotone, so make sure you have some inflection
    in your tone.

  - **Look at your whole audience.** Make eye contact with people if
    you can, but make sure you scan the whole room and don't just look
    at one part of the audience. One trick here is to locate some
    friendly faces in multiple sections of a big audience, then
    address them one at a time in a loop.

  - **Make sure the audience can hear you.** If you aren't sure
    whether the mic or your voice is loud enough, ask the audience if
    they can hear you. Ask the people in the back to raise their hands
    if you get too quiet.

  - **Keep your hands above your waist.** If you do this, you will
    find yourself gesturing naturally.

  - **Remember to breathe.**

  - **Practice without notes.** Even if you'd like to have your notes
    with you to make you less nervous, practicing your talk without
    notes helps you map your content to your thought process. You
    already know your subject matter, so avoid trying to memorize your
    notes and script verbatim. This will help your talk sound more
    natural and for you to feel better about deviating from your
    script.

#### *Facilitator - Proceed to next slide, Better speaker tips, Don’t*

#### Don't:

  - **Don’t drink too much coffee.** You're already jittery from
    nerves, so you don't need a coffee buzz on top of it\!

  - **Don’t turn away from the audience.** If you need to point
    something out in your slides, make sure that you keep your face
    pointed toward the audience as you point.

  - **Don’t use filler words like "um."** You might not even notice
    you are doing this so ask a friend to point it out in rehearsal or
    record yourself and take notes. To help yourself break the filler
    words habit, take a small breath or a sip of water instead.

  - **Don’t read your slides or notes directly.** If you must, make
    sure you look up from your notes, and ad lib at least a little
    bit.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Handling nerves \[content\]*

### Handling Nerves

Everyone gets nervous about public speaking. It is a part of being
human. In fact, it's hard-wired: for our cavemen ancestors, any time
more than 5 pairs of eyes were looking at them at once, that meant that
in all likelihood they were about to die. We still react that way when
we get up in front of a group of people and see them all watching us.

Keep in mind that your audience is on your side – they want to see you
succeed, and all of them would be nervous if they were in your shoes. In
fact, it’s okay to admit that you are nervous – people will be
sympathetic.

Here are some things you can do to help soothe your nerves:

  - **Practice\!** It really does get easier with practice. The more
    you practice the better you will know your material and the more
    confident you will be.

  - **Sleep.** If you are well-rested, you will do a better job.
    Resist the urge to network or socialize too much the night before.

  - **Exercise.** The best way to get rid of nervous energy is to burn
    it off. Physiologically, the reason you get nervous is so that you
    will have the energy and adrenaline to fight or flee from your
    predator. Running or getting some other form of exercise is a
    great way to burn off that nervous energy and convince your body
    that the danger is over.

  - **Breathe.** When we get nervous, we tend to take shallow breaths
    into our chest. This is a part of the body's preparation for fight
    or flight, and it actually deprives the brain of some of its
    important oxygen. Take long slow breaths into your belly, and this
    will help calm you and clear your mind. Be sure to take breaths:

<!-- end list -->

1.  Before getting on stage

2.  When you’re on stage before you start talking, and

3.  Every so often during the talk

<!-- end list -->

  - **Dress comfortably.** Being body-conscious never helps, so make
    sure you are comfortable in whatever you are wearing.

  - **Take time for yourself before you speak.** This helps you
    compose yourself and get mentally prepared. You could go for a
    walk, listen to some favorite music, go over your notes, or just
    take some really deep breaths.

  - **Know the stage.** Try to find a time before you give your talk
    to see the room where you will be speaking.

  - **Use your own devices.** If you have your own laptop, clicker,
    etc., you will be more comfortable with your equipment. If you
    won't be using your own devices, come early to ensure you're able
    to get your notes onto the system and that you can use the system
    with ease.

  - **Adopt a persona.** This doesn't mean don't be yourself, it just
    means be the Speaker version of yourself. For instance, if you
    tend to talk with your hands when you are nervous, embrace that
    and make it a part of your speaker persona. You will behave
    differently when you are in front of a big group of people: go
    with that and don't fight it.

  - **Be excited.** Nervousness could actually be excitement. There’s
    no chemical difference between feeling excited and anxious, it’s
    the same physical state, so if you think you’re nervous, try
    turning it around and remind yourself that you’re just excited.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Handling Q\&A \[content\]*

###   

### Handling Q\&A

### Many talks have an audience questions-and-answer session at the end.

#### Timing

Ask the organizers in advance what the expectations are. Try timing your
talk when you rehearse it and make sure you've left room for an adequate
amount of Q\&A time, if that's something you'll be expected to do.

How much time should you allow for Q\&A? If the organizers haven't
specified this for you, it usually depends on the length of your whole
session. In general, 10-20 minutes is adequate. For example, if your
whole presentation takes up a 45-minute slot you might want to allow 35
minutes for the presentation and 10 minutes for questions.

#### Interspersing Q\&A

Some people prefer to take questions throughout their talk rather than
holding them until the end. Let your audience know up front what you
prefer, bearing in mind that if your audience will be using a microphone
due to the size of the room or the fact that your talk is being
recorded, you'll need to give the room technician a heads-up about your
Q\&A plans so they're ready with the audience microphone as needed.

#### Don't Forget to Ask for Questions\!

If you're saving the Q\&A until the end, don't forget to do it once you
finish your talk\! To remind yourself, you can add a slide at the end of
your talk saying thanks and asking for questions.

#### Repeat the Question Back to the Audience

Unless the audience is mic'd, repeat each question before answering.
Your audience and anyone later watching the video (if your talk is being
recorded) will thank you.

Even if the audience and recording can hear the questions, sometimes
it’s nice to repeat the question for everyone to hear it again, or to
phrase the question more clearly.

#### *Facilitator - Proceed to next slide, Tricky Questions*

#### Some people are especially nervous about the Q\&A because difficult situations could arise. Here are some tips to make it easier.

#### Tricky Questions

Often speakers who are brand new to public speaking, and even ones that
aren't, are nervous about getting asked a question that they feel they
don't know the answer to or that has a tricky answer.

There are a few ways to handle that situation:

  - Remember to repeat the question back to the audience. This buys
    you a little bit of time to think about how to handle the
    question.

  - Don't be afraid to admit that you don't know. The audience will
    have far more respect for you for admitting that you don't know
    than if you try to fudge it and fail.

  - You can say something like: "That's a good question. I'm not sure
    about the answer, but let me look into that for you – could you
    send me a tweet or email after the session and we'll stay in
    touch?"

  - You can throw it to the audience with something like: "Good
    question\! I'm actually not sure, does anyone here have any
    ideas?"

  - Throw the question to a friend or colleague in the audience: "Good
    question\! My colleague Jane actually knows a lot about that – hey
    Jane, do you have any ideas on this one?" You can also talk to
    your colleagues/friends beforehand and make sure they're OK with
    being put on the spot like this.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, The smarty-pants*

#### The Smarty-Pants

Handling the “smarty-pants” in the audience who thinks they know better
than you and goes on and on and on is a big fear. It doesn't happen
often, but if it does, one thing to keep in mind is that in these sorts
of situations, other people in the audience are thinking about how much
of an idiot the know-it-all is, not about how you’re handling it. Don't
be afraid to cut someone off if they're monopolizing the Q\&A or
derailing it. It's possible to do this politely but firmly: "I think
we're going to have to move on now because time is running out and I
really want to get a few more questions in."

#### *Facilitator - Proceed to next slide, Unrelated questions*

#### Unrelated Questions

Sometimes people will ask questions that have little or nothing to do
with your talk and answering the question will derail the conversation.
One way of handling this is to say, "That's a good question, but it's
outside of the scope of what we're talking about. I'd be happy to answer
it for you privately after."

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Silence*

#### Silence

What if you finish your talk, throw open the floor to the audience and
there are no questions? That's totally OK\! There aren't always
questions.

  - You can have one or two people you know in the audience ready to
    ask a question, or even chime in with a different angle. For
    example, if you’re a developer, have a designer ready with an
    observation on your topic from that point of view.

  - You can also ask and answer your own questions. For example:
    "Something I didn't go into in depth in the talk, but that you
    might be wondering about, is…" or "A question I've had come up
    before is..."

  - You can ask the audience a question. For example: "Something I
    didn't go into in depth in the talk, but that you might be
    wondering about, is...” or “A question I’ve had come up before
    is….”

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Errors*

#### Errors

Don't be afraid to correct errors after your talk. If someone points out
an error – either during the Q\&A or later – go ahead and update your
presentation online and include the correction if you give the same talk
again. Be sure to verify that the "correction" is actually accurate
before doing this\!

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Contact & Slides*

####   

#### Contact & Slides

Once the Q\&A is over, let people know how to connect with you once
you're done and where to find your slides. Give out your Twitter handle
and/or email. You can also include this information on your final slide
so that it's up on the screen behind you while you take questions.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Getting post-talk feedback*

### Getting post-talk feedback

We often forget this part of the process, but getting feedback after
your talk is really important if you ever want to get better at public
speaking.

You want to get feedback about both your content and your speaking
style. You want feedback about whether your content was interesting,
well organized, easy to follow, etc. This is true whether you plan to
ever give this same talk again or not because a lot of the knowledge
gained can be generalized. You also want to know about your speaking
technique: How was the pace, volume, approachability, etc.

Where can you get feedback? Ask conference organizers if they send out a
survey, and whether you can see your own feedback. Ask people you know
who were at your talk for feedback. The more specific your questions the
better the feedback you will get. (Don’t ask “What did you think,” ask
“Was there something you thought could have been better? Could you
hear me? Did I speak too quickly or too slowly?" etc.)

Keep in mind that asking people for feedback directly will be different
from asking organizers for the feedback that was sent to them. People
tend to be softer and kinder when speaking to you, as opposed to when
they think that their feedback is only going to organizers.

### Good Slide Decks

Let's first start with a Public Service Announcement. You do **not**
need slides with every talk. Some talks can stand on their own.

Slides can be your friend and your enemy – so, don't rely on them
completely. Something to ask yourself: if the slide projector were to
break down, could you give your talk without them?

That said, when used correctly, slides are amazing and can bring a lot
to your talk.

Used in the right way, slides emphasize and help you get your points
across.

Let's look at some tips for creating good slide decks.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Have a theme*

Give your slides a theme. It could be that you illustrate all your
points with lolcats, or that they all use the same background and
typography. Whatever it is, having a visually unified deck makes all the
difference.

Many speakers end up with a look to their slides that they stick with
from presentation to presentation This is great and makes their talks
stand out and feel part of a cohesive set. It may not be the route you
want to go, but it's something to consider.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, It never looks original*

Don’t use a default slideshow theme, like the templates that come with
Keynote or Powerpoint. We've all seen them a thousand times, and they
look generic and boring.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Don’t write out*

> **ℹ️ *Facilitator*** *- Say this one exactly as below to emphasize the
point*

Don't write out what you are going to be saying. This can be a flexible
rule for useful, important quotes but nobody likes someone reading lines
from a slide.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Don’t use too small text*

Make your text size readable. Think of the person sitting at the back of
the room. Try to use 24 point font and larger when you can.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Code*

Use code sparingly. It’s hard to sit through pages and pages of code on
a screen.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Thanks*

Include a slide at the end of your deck to thank your audience. You can
also use a closing slide to remind you to do your Q\&A.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Find dog food*

Enhance the mood of your talk with slides. Use them to add humor and to
help get your point across.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Know your image source*

Check the copyright on your images. If you're using a Creative Commons
graphic, remember to give proper attribution to its creator.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Pie chart*

Consider sketching something original, creating your own images, or
using your own photography. Make it personal and unique.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Hi\!*

Slides don't need images. You can just have words.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Hi\! (light blue)*

Check your contrast on a range of screens to make sure it'll be legible.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Think about colors*

Also consider your choice of color. You can check color contrast using
an online tool to be sure it'll be easily readable - you just plug in
your background and foreground color codes and the tool will tell you if
it's in the acceptable range.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Unreadable font*

Take care when selecting fonts. Don’t use a fancy font that's cute but
unreadable – and don't use too many different fonts together.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Important bit*

Make sure you're creating your slides for the right screen size. Try to
find out in advance what aspect ratio the projector will have. Stay away
from edges of the screen to be safe, keeping key information out of
those areas.

Now let's look at a few examples from real slide decks.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Effort*

This is a good example of a slide that sets the mood of the whole
presentation. The deck supports the presentation and acts not just as
useful information, but as a backdrop, to help create a cohesive talk.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Anyone can deploy*

This is a deck that stands on its own, either with or without the verbal
part of the presentation. It carries a theme throughout the slides and
delivers the message with clarity. It also demonstrates a strong
personality, something you shouldn’t shy away from with your deck.

> ***Facilitator** - Proceed to next slide, Image of mobile devices*

This deck has a strong sense of design. It clearly delivers the message
of an expansive subject area. Slides are used to break down this
complexity, and it's all done with a clear vision and a deck that stands
on its own, apart from the talk. You'll find a collection of more tips
on creating great slides - and other resources - at

There are links to contrast calculators and examples of inspirational
slide decks that you can explore at your leisure.

### More Tips

Practice going through your deck using an external monitor, using a
presentation mode which lets you see your notes. Think about bringing
your notes printed out on paper in case the presentation setup doesn't
end up allowing you to see your internal notes.

Bring a backup of your slides with you on a thumb drive, including any
special fonts you've used. Save the presentation in a few different
formats, including PDF. If for some reason there's any issue with your
computer, you'll be able to easily borrow someone else's and ensure that
your type looks as you intended.

Upload your slides before your talk if possible, and include a link to
them at the end of your slides. Slideshare and SpeakerDeck are two good
services where you can upload slides. Remember to tweet out the link
afterwards and send it to the event organizers so they can post it.

If you start to do more speaking, invest in a presentation clicker to
advance your slides without having to use a keyboard or mouse. It'll let
you stand away from your laptop and keep your hands in a more natural
position while you speak.

#### Live Demos

It can be very tempting to do a live demo and hop back and forth between
your demo and the slides. This can be hard to watch, especially if
something goes wrong during the demo, as it often does. Consider
recording these bits instead and embedding the videos within your
presentation.
